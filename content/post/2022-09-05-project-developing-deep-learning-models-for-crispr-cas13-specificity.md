CRISPR/Cas13 is a programmable RNA-targeting system with a significant therapeutic potential. However, there is a lack of method for designing highly specific CRISPR/Cas13 systems. We have generated a large data set with high-throughput genomic assays and a previous DSI scholar has developed a transformer-based model that is capable of predicting targeting specificity from RNA sequences. We are looking for a motivated student with a strong deep learning background and a basic understanding of molecular biology to improve the model and publish the result.
