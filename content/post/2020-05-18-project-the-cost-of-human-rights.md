Under United States securities laws corporations must disclose material risks to their operations. Human rights issues, especially in authoritarian countries, rarely show up in the information that data providers offer to investors, in part due to the risks to those subject to these abuses. The result is a dearth of data on human rights materiality and the tendency of investors to overlook human rights risks of the companies that they finance. 

<!--more-->

During the period 2013-2016, the nonprofit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), an initiative supported by the world’s largest institutional investors, examined the impact of human rights on corporate performance as part of an effort to assess the materiality of "social and environmental" issues. Issues that turned up solid relationships to company performance were incorporated into the sustainability disclosure standards that were published in 2018. At the time, the skills to perform big data analytics were not widely available, and consequently few strong correlations between financial loss and human rights risks were found. In addition, in the time since the standards were being developed new concerns about what constitutes a corporation's responsibility to human rights have been brought to the public's attention. For example, the positions of social media companies on content moderation is highly topical, however not strictly deemed material for the purposes of sustainability.

These standards for what counts as a financially material disclosure will be updated according to a project-based process. This project, organized by the non-profit [Rights CoLab](https://rightscolab.org), will work closely with SASB on evolving their standards in the domain of human capital, e.g. modern slavery, labor organization, contract employment, etc.. This work promises to have a significant positive impact on the individuals and communities who are at risk of harm from business operations. 

The DFG team is looking for additional members to join a team already at work, analyzing proxy statements for indications of investor interest and overlap with SASB's sustainability categories. Future work will involve the evaluation of the materiality of various human capital reporting metrics.
