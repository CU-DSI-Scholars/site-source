Under United States securities laws corporations must disclose material risks to their operations. Human rights issues, especially in authoritarian countries, rarely show up in the information that data providers offer to investors, in part due to the risks to those subject to these abuses. The result is a dearth of data on human rights materiality and the tendency of investors to overlook human rights risks of the companies that they finance.

During the period 2011-2015, the nonprofit Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), an initiative supported by the world’s largest institutional investors, examined the impact of human rights on corporate performance as part of an effort to assess the materiality of "social and environmental" issues. Issues that turned up solid relationships to company performance were incorporated into the sustainability disclosure standards that were published in 2018. At the time, big data analytics were in their infancy and few strong correlations between financial loss and human rights risks were found. As a consequence, and as part of the change the mechanisms of public-corporate relationships, many issues that have arisen since that time were not included. For example, the positions of social media companies on content moderation is highly topical, however not strictly deemed material for the purposes of sustainability.

These standards for what counts as a financially material disclosure will be updated in 2021. It is important that a wider and more sophisticated view of how human rights outcomes are associated with changes in company performance be derived. This project's aim is to improve upon the SASB human rights sustainability standards by first replicating the 2011-2015 analysis with modern data and then bring it up-to-date with modern machine learning methods. There is the potential for future access to private corporate news tracking data services which can be paired with social media data using natural language processing. This work promises to have a significant positive impact on the individuals and communities who are at risk of harm from business operations.

The Data For Good program is designed primarily for volunteers, however one candidate will be selected as a project coordinator and will receive a stipend via the Data For Good Scholars program. In addition to the responsibilities of a team member, the selected candidate will be responsible for keeping up-to-date notes on the project's status, writing an end-of-period report, and attending bi-weekly meetings with a DFG program director. The project coordinator should strive to keep the group of volunteers in sync with the needs of the project owner.
