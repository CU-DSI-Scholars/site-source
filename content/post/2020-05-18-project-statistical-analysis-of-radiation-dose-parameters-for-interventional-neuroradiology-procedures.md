From May 2018 to September 2019, we prospectively recorded radiation exposure parameters for 634 neuro-procedures performed at a single, academic medical center. Procedures were performed with a biplane angiographic system.

<!--more-->

Radiation parameters, including dose-area product (DAP), cumulative air kerma, and fluoroscopic time, were obtained for diagnostic cerebral angiograms (n= 367), cerebral embolizations (n=93), and stroke thrombectomies (n=47). 
This is a single, academic medical centerâ€™s experience utilizing a low-dose radiation system for diagnostic cerebral angiograms, cerebral embolizations, and stroke thrombectomies to establish reference levels for these procedures.

## Outcome

Data analysis and help with statistical graphs for publication.

## Learning opportunity

Opportunity to do statistical analysis on radiation dose parameters for interventional neuroradiology procedures.
