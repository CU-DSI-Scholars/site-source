Autonomous driving is developing rapidly. A lot of breakthroughs of autonomous driving have emerged in both academy and industry. However, many traffic accidents related to autonomous driving also occur and cause peopleâ€™s concern on the safety issue of AV. To ensure safety and reliability, rigorous test and simulation is required before AV can really drive on road. For AV test and simulation, realistic data is an essential component. Comprehensive, multi-regime and sufficient self-driving data would definitely help the AV development.

This project is to analyze Waymo and Lyft data, two newly opened datasets comprising of Level-5 self-driving cars ( https://waymo.com/open/, https://level5.lyft.com/dataset/). Diverse sources of data are covered, including camera, lidar and radar. Our task is to identify the vehicle information from such multi-modal data, that is the position and velocity of each surroundings car. The first step is to explore the existing label in the dataset, which would already provide enough information for our traffic research. The second step, if time permits, is to apply the state-of-art detection algorithm to identify more car information. In the second step, computer vision techniques and statistics inference would be used.
