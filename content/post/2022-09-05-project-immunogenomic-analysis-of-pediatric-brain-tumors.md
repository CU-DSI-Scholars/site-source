Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) is a universally fatal pediatric brain tumor with an overall median survival of 9 to 11 months. As the molecular and genetic landscape of DIPG has become increasingly characterized over recent years, numerous clinical trials have explored a variety of targeted therapies. However, none have meaningfully prolonged survival.

Immunotherapy is a rapidly developing field of precision medicine that has positively transformed the prognoses of many adult cancers and holds great promise for the treatment of pediatric tumors. However, DIPG in particular has been shown to have an immunologically cold and non-inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Therefore, strategies are needed to stimulate a physiologically permissible immune component in the DIPG TIME, which can then be targeted properly by immunotherapy.

Our research project evaluates combination regimens of radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for DIPG and uses immunogenomic analysis to identify mechanisms of pro-tumor immunosuppression and novel markers for immunotherapeutic targeting. Students will work with both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from human patients and murine models, leveraging different computational pipelines to illuminate differences between treatments and the genomic-level changes that occur with tumor progression and treatment administration. Students will also have an opportunity to validate their findings and examine the spatial relationships of cells through proteomics and multiplex platforms.
