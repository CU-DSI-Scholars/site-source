The goal of the fellowship is to promote biomedical informatics and health data science as a career choice for young scientists in training. The fellowship takes place in an inclusive research and learning environment. Students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups are encouraged to apply.

The fellowship is six weeks long (July 1st, 2019 to August 12th, 2019). At the end of the fellowship, fellows will have gained computing and research skills, familiarity with the fields of informatics and health data science, experience with real-world, massive health datasets from electronic health records and the data acumen that comes with handling such datasets, along with understanding of the complex ethical and fairness questions inherent to biomedical informatics and health data science research.

Applications open December 10 and are due February 4, 2019. Notification of acceptance is March 15, 2019. Select fellows will receive a stipend. More at http://summer.dbmi.columbia.edu/.
