Structural variants (SVs) are large genomic alterations which can be implicated in disease. This project will focus on using novel genomic techniques to identify structural variants in genomic cold cases with neurological disorders. These "cold" cases which have previously remained unsolved with standard genomic approaches. We will use optical genome mapping and long read sequencing, together with novel bioinformatic techniques to detect and analyze structural variants.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Isabelle Schrauwen](https://statgen.us/Main_Page)
+ Center/Lab: Neurology
+ Location: NewYork-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center, 630 West 168th Street, NYC, NY; 19th floor
+ Our research focuses on examining the genetic basis and pathogenic mechanisms of sensory and neurological disorders. We implement both family-based and population-based methods to identify genetic factors involved in various forms of hereditary diseases.
