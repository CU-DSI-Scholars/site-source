Columbia University [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/) is pleased to announce that the Data Science Institute (DSI) Scholars Program for Spring-Summer 2019 is open for application. The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University's undergraduate and master's students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.

The second cohort of [Spring-Summer 2019 projects](https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/categories/project-2019/) are ready to accept applications. We created an [**umbrella application page**](https://goo.gl/forms/RlCEowm2dK8doSNq1) to collect student applications. These projects have a wide range of duration and can be either **paid** or **unpaid**. Therefore, please read each project description carefully before applying. Housing will NOT be provided.

The collected applications for each position will be sent to the hosting faculty/center/lab for review. The faculty/center/lab will **review, identify and notify** Scholars that they would like to interview and select for their own projects. 

In addition to working on a research project, student research interns will be invited to participate in the following DSI scholars activities.

+ *Bootcamp on Data Science Research skills* - During the first week of the summer 2019 internships, we will run a Bootcamp on data science research skills. All DSI Scholars are encouraged to attend.

+ *Scholars in Data Science* weekly meetup series - Throughout the summer, this weekly series will provide *DSI Scholars* the opportunities to learn about data science research outside their own project. Each session will be led by a data scientist at Columbia and will consist of a 45-minute seminar talk and a 45-minute hands-on activity.

+ Fall 2019 *DSI Scholars Research Poster Social*: All DSI Scholars will be invited to present their summer research during a DSI poster social at the beginning of the Fall semester 2019-2020.

**The Data Science Institute encourages women and underrepresented minorities to apply to this program.**
