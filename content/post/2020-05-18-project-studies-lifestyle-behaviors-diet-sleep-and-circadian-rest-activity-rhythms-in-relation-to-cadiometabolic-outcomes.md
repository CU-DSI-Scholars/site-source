I  am conducting studies on lifestyle behaviors, in particular diet, sleep behaviors, and circadian rest-activity rhythms in relation to cardiometabolic outcomes (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity). Sample sizes of my studies range from n=100 to n=16,000.

## Outcome

Analytic support: I would like to work with a student/trainee who is statistician or has expertise in epidemiology and/or biostatistics to help with statistical analyses. I am happy to provide co-authorship on resulting published manuscripts and abstracts as appropriate.

## Learning opportunity

Opportunity to conduct analyses on lifestyle in relation to cardiometabolic risk in population-based studies and possibly be a co-author on resulting publications.
