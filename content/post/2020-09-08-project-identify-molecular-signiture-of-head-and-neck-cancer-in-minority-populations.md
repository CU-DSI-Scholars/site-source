A highly collaborative project is available in Dr. Alison Taylor’s and Dr. Fatemeh Momen-Heravi’s lab. This project aims to identify molecular changes such as mutations and RNA signature of head and neck cancer in Black/African American and Hispanic minority populations with the goal of identifying novel therapies for cancer patients and reduce health disparities. The project entails analysis of DNA and RNA sequencing data.
