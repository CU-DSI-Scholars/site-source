The introduction of a new technology provides individuals and companies with a large, unowned, and limitless space for communication and organization. How do individuals use or misuse this space in their decision making? Using the online discussion platform Reddit, we seek to analyze what types of subreddits thrive those with depth of discussion or topical complexity or those with cohesive contours? Are there high status actors who are particularly good at recognizing topic gaps which need new subreddits? By merging the Reddit archives with meta data from the public platform, we will be able to observe the rise and fall of online discussions.
