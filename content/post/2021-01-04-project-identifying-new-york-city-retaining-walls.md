Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to.
They were used to facilitate the city’s development in hilly areas. Students may be familiar with the
Morningside Park retaining wall , present immediately East of the Columbia campus. Retaining walls
facing streets are mapped and inspected. Not so retaining walls supporting soil at back yards. Because
the NYC Building Department is not aware of the presence of most, they are not inspected and left to
decay. A fatal collapse occurred in October 2020.

The project involved developing a computer application that identifies possible location of back yard
retaining walls by measuring the difference of elevation between the streets that define a city block. The
elevation of every street or road in NYC is available in open data. The tasks requires computer
programing skills. Mapping capacity would be helpful. There is no need to understand the engineering
used to maintain the stability of these structures.

+ Dan Eschenasy, Chief Structural Engineers, NYC Buildings

The Department of Buildings promotes the safety of all people that build, work, and live in New York City by regulating the lawful use of over one million buildings and construction sites across the five boroughs. With a focus on safety, service, and integrity, the Department enforces the City’s Construction Codes, Zoning Resolution, and the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law.

The Department enforces compliance with these regulations and promotes worker and public safety through its review and approval of building plans, permitting and licensing functions, and inspections. In addition to Code and Zoning compliance review, emergency response and professional analysis of accidents to prevent future incidents, the Department has strengthened its education and outreach programs to provide the construction industry, property owners and tenants with a heightened understanding of safety awareness.

The Department is committed to providing efficient service to all New Yorkers by continuously assessing the equitable distribution of resources to meet the safety and permitting needs of residents across all five boroughs; enhancing the quality of life for all New Yorkers and making our City safer.
