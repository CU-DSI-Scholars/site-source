Background: The Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR) provides investigators access to laboratory and statistical analyses aimed at incorporating and expanding environmental exposures within their research. To benefit the broader scientific community, the HHEAR Data Repository houses deidentified epidemiologic and biomarker data from all studies accepted into the HHEAR program. To date, 46 studies including data from over 36,000 individuals are part of the HHEAR program. Of those studies, 26 have deposited their data in the HHEAR Data Repository. More information on HHEAR can be found at hheardatacenter.mssm.edu.

Description of Project and Data: To facilitate the secondary analysis of these pooled environmental health data, we are seeking to create interactive dashboards for the scientific community to access descriptives of the data within the HHEAR Repository. Data within the Repository are structured and include demographic, biomarker, questionnaire and health data. All data have been harmonized to a common ontology to facilitate harmonization across studies. As a complement to the dashboards, we will also be creating a series of analytic examples to serve as analysis tutorials. Examples of sample analyses include creating summaries of biomarkers of exposure and comparing them to population-estimates from NHANES, the application of mixture methods to pooled data and other common analyses using HHEAR Data. 

Tasks: The selected student will work as part of a team to construct dashboards, visualizations and example analytic pipelines. Tasks also include data cleaning, harmonizing data across studies and creating shareable programming scripts.
