Our Lyme Research Center gathered a lot of data on patients who attended our center for research and/or treatment. All this data is currently stored in pdf format and contain formal tables with assessments, text, picture, etc.  We need help in a project to extract valuable information from these pdfs and create a database that will store various types of data.  This task may involve pdf parsing, organization of a database, import to clinical electronic data capture systems, etc. If you like to organize data and like challenges, this is a project for you.
