I will use Twitter data to assess the popularity and reach of false claims affecting Latinos regarding Covid-19, the 2020 election, and the Biden presidency. I also plan to characterize these data using text analysis methods in order to recover general themes or topics, and how they varied as a function of geography, time, and user characteristics. I have access to the Twitter academic API.
