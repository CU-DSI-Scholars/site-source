Getting a better approximation of the age of a NYC’s building can improve assigning the building to a structural type that includes type of construction and relevant building code in effect. Mapping the age and type of building would help NYC DOB and the City on a number of fronts, which include enabling NYC DOB to be more effective in enforcing  building and construction safety and evaluating risk when adjacent or nearby subsurface construction is proposed. Furthermore, the more precise characterization of NYC buildings will improve efforts by the City to craft policies aimed at energy efficiency (TWG) as it drives to 80% GHG reductions by 2050 (80X50) and determining natural disaster vulnerability of its building stock (HAZUS).

This project will focus on Brooklyn with the purpose of developing a map of building age and associated original building materials using Sanborn maps, 2-D digitized historic real estate  and insurance maps, open NYC data (Pluto, HPD, LPC, DOB), and other data sources that collectively provide a richer source of information than what is reflected in other data systems presently in use.  Once this project demonstrates the proof of concept, the methodology created by the student team could then be expanded across all areas of the city.

Building age data (DATE BUILT) in the City’s PLUTO database/map (at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) for buildings initially constructed before WWII is often imprecise, if not wrong, and hampers understanding the original building’s age and associated constructed characteristics for NYC DOB’s building safety enforcement activities and for the City’s energy policies and laws in connection with its 80X50 initiative. This imprecision has been transferred to the building characteristics portion of the HAZUS predictive model for NYC building failure rates for hurricane and earthquake scenarios.

The Department of Buildings promotes the safety of all people that build, work, and live in New York City by regulating the lawful use of over one million buildings and construction sites across the five boroughs. With a focus on safety, service, and integrity, the Department enforces the City’s Construction Codes, Zoning Resolution, and the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law.

The Department enforces compliance with these regulations and promotes worker and public safety through its review and approval of building plans, permitting and licensing functions, and inspections. In addition to Code and Zoning compliance review, emergency response and professional analysis of accidents to prevent future incidents, the Department has strengthened its education and outreach programs to provide the construction industry, property owners and tenants with a heightened understanding of safety awareness.

The Department is committed to providing efficient service to all New Yorkers by continuously assessing the equitable distribution of resources to meet the safety and permitting needs of residents across all five boroughs; enhancing the quality of life for all New Yorkers and making our City safer.

## Project timeline
+ Earliest starting date: 10/01/2020
+ End date: 01/01/2021
+ Number of hours per week of research expected during Fall 2020: ~10
+ Project is ongoing and will be reviewed for future directions at the end of the semester

## Candidate requirements
+ Skill sets: All students should have excellent data analytic skills, since the bulk of the data is historical, and geospatial data analytic skills, and an interest in the buildings in a dense urban environment under conditions of climate change would be helpful.
+ Student eligibility: freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, master's
+ International students: **eligible**
