What predicts successful learning? Many variables complicate the collaborative paradigm of learning or skills acquisition, and while the relative contribution of those variables has been studied in isolation, a comprehensive understanding of their synergistic effects remains elusive. The objective of this project is  to specifically establish a framework allowing neurofeedback training in the classroom to help studentsâ€™ performance. This project aims to develop a flexible neuroscience and technology-driven framework for Discipline-Based Education Research (Neuro-DBER) to revolutionize teaching and learning. Our system merges cognitive neuroscience, education, and innovative technology to enable investigations of the relationships between subjective experience, body language, real-time learning, and neural measures of attentional engagement. Neuro-DBER is a flexible technological framework suitable to any field of study to address critical questions about learning experiences, such as the gap between a student's subjective feelings versus objective measures of content retention.
