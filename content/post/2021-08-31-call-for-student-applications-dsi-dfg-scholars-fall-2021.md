Columbia University [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/) is pleased to announce that the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Data For Good Scholars programs for Spring-Summer 2021 are open for application.

The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia University's undergraduate and master's students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.

The Data For Good Scholars program connects student volunteers to organizations and individuals working for the social good whose projects have developed a need for data science expertise. As "real world" problems with real world data, these projects are excellent opportunities for students to learn how data science is practiced outside of the university setting and to learn how to work effectively with people for whom data science sits outside of their subject area.

The cohort of [Fall](/categories/open-fall-2021) 2021 projects are ready to accept applications, and can be seen by clicking through those links. To obtain a scroll of all projects, including those from past years, see [here](/). We have created an [**umbrella application page**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15k4RmA8L7dwp2S_NxJ2CzUzDD1JnuOAkLBnkFSCZ3_Y/edit) to collect student applications. DSI Scholars projects have a wide range of duration and can be either **paid** or **unpaid**. Projects supported with stipends may have a trial period and are not a form of paid employment; please read each project description carefully before applying. Data For Good projects are primarily volunteer, although one student in each may be given a stipend to coordinate communication.

An online information session was held on Friday January 15th, 2021 at 11:00am Eastern time. Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SML70xp-rUyMNlt5RSjQgPhW3ILzmzEZPcweM6jqvLk/edit?usp=sharing), and a recording [here](https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/rec/play/Hplgkv2tr-uax2QagCxVF5ruJWEmPG7PA4vxF5x-ZO7PHEDr8qSHONs7YTWsjwADRHzx5pTLMSJ2Apbw.kSi75dWaHV3qLOVU?continueMode=true).
