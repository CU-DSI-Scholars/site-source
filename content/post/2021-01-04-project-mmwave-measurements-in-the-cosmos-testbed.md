5G cellular networks will use high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which promises high data rates and ample spectrum availability. Students working on this project will help conduct a mmWave wireless channel measurement campaign around the COSMOS testbed (www.cosmos-lab.org), a wireless networking testbed located at Columbia stretching between 120th and 136th St. In collaboration with Bell Labs students will be able to use unique, state-of-the-art mmWave equipment to conduct these measurements (see pre-pandemic example in https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/mmNets2019_COSMOS_28GHz.pdf). The measurements will play an important role in the development of network-level control algorithms, which is the other, more analytical side of this research project.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Gil Zussman](https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu)
+ Department/School: Electrical Engineering
+ Location: CEPSR 8th floor
+ The lab focuses on the design and performance evaluation of protocols and applications for future wireless and wired networks (e.g., beyond-5G, VR/AR, etc.). Among other things, lab members collect data and conduct experiments on the COSMOS testbed (https://cosmos-lab.org) and apply various techniques including learning in networks and learning for network optimization.
