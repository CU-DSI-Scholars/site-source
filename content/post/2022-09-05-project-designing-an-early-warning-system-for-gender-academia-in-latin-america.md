WGGA at the Institute for the Study of Human Rights at Columbia University and CoreWoman aim to bring scholars together to help strengthen the resilience of the “gender academy” and contribute to its capacity for institutional and intellectual innovation. WGGA with the support of CoreWoman is exploring the creation of an Early-Warning System to provide information, resources, and support to gender scholars potentially acing illiberal attacks. The pilot project will be launched in Latin America, and ultimately, include other regions. The pilot in three Latin American countries, to allow for testing some hypotheses of the Early-Warning System. Some possible candidates include México, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Venezuela.

Activity I: Survey among scholars in the Latin American region. This survey will allow to understand the possible “attacks” and censorship some gender scholars might have experienced and help select the countries for the pilot study. 

Activity 2: Implementation of semi-structured interviews with a sample of scholars to deepen the understanding of the survey and each country's context, as well as to create a clear definition of what "attack” means (cuts in funding, pressure leading to self-censorship, legal dispositions, closing or merging gender departments, etc.). 

Activity 3: Use Artificial Intelligence (AI to analyze millions of data points and thousands of governments, university documents (Big Data) in each country.

Activity 4: Track trends in the media, social media and Twitter to identify possible early signs  of attacks on gender studies in the selected countries, governments' laws, regulations, and dispositions that could promote attacks on gender studies in universities.

Activity 5: Analyze the evolution of the curriculum in universities and published and working papers (dates to be defined).
