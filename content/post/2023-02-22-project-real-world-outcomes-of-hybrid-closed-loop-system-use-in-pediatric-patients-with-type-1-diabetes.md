Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that requires patients to need lifelong insulin therapy. Diabetes technology (insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGM)) have been shown to reduce the risk of high and low blood sugars and thus reduce long term diabetes complications. Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pumps integrate CGM technology to automatically adjust insulin delivery from the pump, with the goal of improved blood sugar and better quality of life for the patient. There are two commonly used HCL systems in our diabetes center: the t:slim x2 with Control IQ (TS) and the Omnipod 5 (O5).

The TS uses an algorithm adjust insulin delivery using predicted CGM values, with the goal of increasing the percent time in the glucose target range (between 70-180 mg/dl). The O5 system is the newest FDA approved HCL system and is the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system. Like the TS, it uses CGM readings to adjust insulin delivery to keep blood sugars within range.

Our study aims to collect real-world data on use of HCL systems in a large urban academic diabetes center. We will assess whether use of either HCL system increases percent time in the glucose target range (70-180 mg/dL) and lowers hemoglobin A1c without significant low blood sugars in patients compared to their previous insulin delivery system. Additionally, we aim to evaluate quality of life using two validated survey tools at specific time points in the patient's treatment. The Diabetes Distress Scale (DSS) is a validated 17 item tool to assess the burden of disease in four dimensions of distress: emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress, and physician distress. The Insulin Device Satisfaction Survey (IDSS) is a validated 14 item scale for evaluating the effectiveness, burdensomeness, and convenience of insulin delivery systems
