We are collecting and analyzing survey data asking people about the political attitudes and other characteristics of their family, friends, and others in their social circles. Some of this work is described [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/penumbra_paper_11_clean.pdf) and we are also doing polling relevant to the 2018 midterm elections.
