Our primary objective for this work will be to build a GMR model that can correct for bias in low cost particulate matter (PM2.5) sensors to be used globally. We will select 5-10 diverse reference PM2.5 and low cost PM2.5 co-locations to build a Gaussian Mixture Regression model (GMR). Recently, our team showed that GMR provides a higher quality correction factor for PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors than multiple linear regression and random forest, in terms of both correlation and accuracy. We then plan to evaluate this model on at least 20 independent co-location datasets that the GMR has not seen. There has been an exciting recent rise in commercially available low-cost sensors (LCS), such as PurpleAir (www.purpleair.com) and Clarity sensors, which when paired with machine learning (ML) based correction algorithms demonstrate high accuracy compared to co-located reference grade monitors5,6. So far, these corrections have been limited to the few LCS locations which are co-located with expensive reference-grade monitors, while the potential from the thousands of un-co-located sensors remains untapped. PurpleAir and similar devices have been deployed all over the world. Ideally our global correction factor will allow for the extraction of more trustworthy data from huge open-access databases of air pollution data such as PurpleAir.
