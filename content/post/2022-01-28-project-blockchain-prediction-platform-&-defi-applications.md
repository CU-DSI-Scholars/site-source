Our lab conducts research in machine learning and blockchains. We have published more than 150 publications/patents/monographs to date. Prediction Markets have been used to forecast outcomes of research interest using market mechanisms (See https://www.nature.com/news/the-power-of-prediction-markets-1.20820). A decentralized prediction market, Augur, has been created on blockchain for betting purposes (See, https://www.augur.net/). An alternative approach to prediction market has been proposed in Dalal et al (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162511000734).  
This project develops a new hybrid model for decentralized collaborative prediction market that can be used to elicit opinions of university researchers on socially important issues. Specifically, the project uses Ethereum based platform to develop a smart contract and an ERC-20 compliant token for researchers to participate in the new market. The smart contract is being developed in Solidity and Javascript. The corresponding frontend and backend uses Django and python on AWS cloud. The UI part is in JS which needs to get a more user friendly design.
