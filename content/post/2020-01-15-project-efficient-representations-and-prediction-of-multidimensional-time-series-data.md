Big data with temporal dependence brings unique challenges in effective prediction and data analysis. The complex high-dimensional interactions between observations in such data brings unique challenges which standard off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms cannot handle. Even basic tasks of clustering, visualization and identification of recurring patterns are difficult. 

<!--more-->

The aim of this project is to design techniques for efficient representations of such high dimensional timeseries for exploratory data analysis. Taking financial timeseries data as a test bed, we will examine how one can design effective models in this complex regime.
