This project aims to create/develop a smartphone application for use with our pediatric cardiology patients. The application would be a "patient passport," which essentially would be a snapshot of their most critical medical information. It will not be linked to the clinical health records; rather, it needs to be a template with various questions that we would create (name, diagnosis, surgeries, current medications, etc). The doctor would fill out the information with the patient, and it would then be saved on the patient's phone for them to show other healthcare professionals. We are looking for a student who can help us design this app (from a technological perspective) and get it up and running. It would need to be encrypted and password protected.
