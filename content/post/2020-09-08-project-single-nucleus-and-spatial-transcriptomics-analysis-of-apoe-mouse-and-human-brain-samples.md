We are conducting a large-scale study analyzing brain tissues from mice and humans with different APOE genotypes, using both single-nucleus sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to assess RNA expression differences caused by APOE genotype. We are working with an expert bioinformatics core, but would like a data science student to help perform the analyses and act as an in-lab lead for the bioinformatics analysis. Prior experience analyzing RNA-sequencing data is preferred, but not required.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Tal Nuriel](http://columbianeuroresearch.org/taub/faculty-nuriel.html)
+ Department/School: Pathology and Cell Biology
+ Location: P&S 12-430
+ My lab's research revolves around understanding the role of the APOE4 gene in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Our primary approach is to use top-down, systems biology tools to identify novel pathway effects caused by APOE4 gene expression.
