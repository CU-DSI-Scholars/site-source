Through a collaboration between Columbia University and the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), we are seeking a data scientist with JAVA, machine learning and/or SQL skills along with good writing, administrative and organizational abilities to contribute to the developing infrastructure and modeling of an extensible master person index (MPI) and data management solution. The intern would work directly with DOHMH scientists.

Data is central to the DOHMH's mission to protect and promote the health of all New Yorkers. The agency’s many programs often require large scale record linkages. Epidemiologists use linked datasets to work on a range of public health issues; disease-specific teams also conduct surveillance for over 90 reportable diseases and conditions. In 2015, an intra-agency Matching Work Group found that record linkage, whether conducted for research and evaluation, surveillance, or clinical practice were extremely or prohibitively labor intensive, and sometimes highly duplicative. This was the impetus for developing an AI-enabled MPI system.

The intern would focus their efforts on one or more of the following:
·        enhancements to the user interface
·        write, review, test and run scripts against the MPI and improve MPI services
·        evaluate and optimize machine learning - data matching model
·        improve system documentation and project planning

+ Earliest starting date: 03/04/2019
+ End date: 08/23/2019
+ Number of hours per week of research expected during Spring 2019: ~10
+ Number of hours per week of research expected during Summer 2019: ~40

## Candidate requirements
+ Skill sets: Programming proficiency in JAVA and SQL; experience with machine learning; 
+ Student eligibility  (as of Spring 2019): ~~freshman~~, ~~sophomore~~, ~~junior~~, ~~senior~~, master's
+ International students on F1 or J1 visa: **NOT** eligible
+ Additional comments: Human Subjects Protection Training will be required at start of position.
