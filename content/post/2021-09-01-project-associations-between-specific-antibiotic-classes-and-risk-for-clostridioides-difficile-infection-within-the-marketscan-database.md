Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is highly associated with antibiotic exposure, but it is uncertain which classes of antibiotics confer the greatest risk for CDI.  This project will use the MarketScan database, a large commercial insurance billing database containing 40 million patient records, outpatient antibiotic prescription data, and ICD-based disease information, to test for associations between specific antibiotic classes and risk for CDI.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Daniel Freedberg](None)
+ Center/Lab: Freedberg (me)
+ Location: P&S 3-401
+ I am a gastroenterologist and a clinical-translational researcher focused on the role of the gut microbiome in enteric and systemic infections.  Relevant for this project, I am interested in the pharmacoepidemiology of enteric infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI).  Past pharmacoepidemiology projects related to CDI have included studies of proton pump inhibitors (anti-acid medications), antibiotics, and immunosuppressants.
