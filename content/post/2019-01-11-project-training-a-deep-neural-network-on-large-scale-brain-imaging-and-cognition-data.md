The goal of this project is to develop and validate a deep neural network that predicts a child's emotion and cognition. DSI scholars will implement 3D convolutional neural networks on brain imaging data from thousands of children to predict cognitive, emotional, and socio-developmental variables. Statistical evaluation of the model performance will be conducted. The scalable deep neural network analysis will help find brain underpinnings of cognition and emotion.
