Rights CoLab (https://rightscolab.org/) is working with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to define a strengthened set of disclosure standards that investors can use to persuade companies to improve labor rights for both their workforce and workers in supply chains. The project has two components: 1) a data science project, and 2) an Expert Group. 

<!--more-->

The data science project uses natural language processing, machine learning, and other data science techniques on a wide range of data sets - including Form 10Ks, proxy statements, earnings calls, news and lawsuit databases -- to identify new relationships between labor-related human rights risks and financial materiality. The Expert Group provides subject matter expertise to the data project and makes recommendations on how to incorporate relevant findings into revised SASB standards to benefit workers while reducing reputational, operational, and legal risks for companies. 
Full details on this project can be found on this page: https://rightscolab.org/project-harnessing-big-data/.

This project offers both volunteer roles for students to use their skills for the social good and roles eligible for a matching fund stipend from the Data Science Institute. This is not a guarantee of payment, and the total amount is subject to available funding.
