## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Adam Poliak](https://azpoliak.github.io/)
+ Department/School: Computer Science/Barnard
+ We study the reasoning capabilities and biases in natural language processing models. We also apply natural language processing to other fields to glean insights from large amounts of text.
