Students will design and contribute new features to the AI Model Share MLOps Platform.  Projects will allow students first hand experience working with and developing MLOps tools including model deployment, continuous model improvement, and ML analytics.  Individualized projects will allow students to 1) integrate advanced deep learning models into our system, 2) work on ML model replication tools, 3) integrate new ML dashboards into our toolkit, and more.
