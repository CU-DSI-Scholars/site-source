Scholars would assist with Aim 1 of a new R01 working with our lab and the Health Evaluation and Analytics Laboratory at NYU Wagner.

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States (US), affecting ~40,000 births per year in the US. (1) One-year mortality for these children is >10%.  It is >30% for children requiring neonatal surgery. (2) Yet there are currently limited data on long-term outcomes and health expenditures for these children.  Due to marked heterogeneity in disease subtypes and treatments among CHD patients, the power of single-center studies is limited.  Multi-center data are siloed in diagnostic or procedural registries or in-patient databases, or are the product of individual investigations.  Administrative data may lack clinical precision, as ICD codes for this population are not based on physiology.  Further, data on costs and value typically rely on cost-to-charge ratio based costs, which are highly influenced by hospital accounting.

Scholars will assist in linking clinical registry data from all congenital heart surgical centers in New York State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index to establish a novel population-based mechanism for longitudinal tracking of risk-adjusted outcomes, resource utilization, and health expenditures that encompasses both granular clinical details and social determinants of health.  

Aim 1: Define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across NY State. 

- 1.1 Compare probabilistic and deterministic methods of data linkage between state-wide records from a pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry and NY State Medicaid in-patient claims files.
- 1.2 Define 10-year risk-stratified multi-dimensional outcomes and expenditures.
