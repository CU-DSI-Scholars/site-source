This project is a collaboration between Columbia scholars and students and leadership at the Malcolm X  & Dr. Betty Shabazz Center. The goal is to create programming and intellectual resources inspired by the legacy of Dr. Shabazz and Malcolm X through public events, workshops and data science activities. Part of this work will involve using computational methods to analyze existing publications around Malcolm X's work, as well as develop a corpus of research materials by effectively digitizing the contents of the publicly-available FBI files about his life.

This effort is a continuation of an existing partnership with the Center that seeks to develop a more equitable partnership between Columbia and the Shabazz Center, which has been consistently marginalized even in its own physical space. We believe this work will help lay the foundation for a more inclusive and mutually beneficial relationship that will meaningfully benefit the university, the Shabazz Center and the broader Harlem community.
