Stroke is devastating when left untreated. Early treatment significantly improves outcomes, and can be reliably detected using the FAST exam. The exam looks for facial asymmetry, arm weakness, and speech deficits as signs of stroke. Our research project aims to use smartphone technology to build a stroke detection algorithm based on the FAST exam. We have collected speech data of hospitalized stroke patients. The next step is to build an algorithm that can detect abnormal speech.

The speech data consists of both patient video and audio. Strokes can cause a number of different changes to a patient’s speech, including but not limited to aphasia, dysarthria, and paraphasic errors. Modeling speech will therefore need to take into account the wide range of potential deficits. Furthermore, the data collected is noisy, with extraneous input from the hospital. It will need to be pre-processed and isolated. This project will consist of two parts: 

1) Preprocessing and cleaning of data to isolate the patient’s voice. 
2) Modeling to detect specific categories of speech deficits as mentioned above. 

Third-party API usage is limited to APIs that can be run locally because of the personal nature of the data.
