Columbia University [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/) is pleased to announce the launch of the Data Science Institute (DSI) Scholars Program for the Inaugural Class of Summer 2018. The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage Columbia's undergraduate and master students in data science research with Columbia faculty through a research internship. The program connects students with research projects across Columbia and provides student researchers with an additional learning experience and networking opportunities. Through unique enrichment activities, this program aims to foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia.

The first cohort of [Summer 2018 projects](https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/categories/project-2018/) are ready to accept applications. We created an [**umbrella application page**](https://goo.gl/forms/S4jXM9FOtzLpzn5p1) to collect student applications. The collected applications for each position will be sent to the hosting faculty/center/lab for review. The faculty/center/lab will review and identify the Scholars they prefer for their own projects. Each Summer 2018 student researcher will receive $5,000 stipend for the duration of the project. Housing will NOT be provided.

In addition to working on a research project, student research interns will be invited to participate in the following DSI scholars activities.

+ *Initiation Bootcamp on Data Science Research skills* - During the first week of the summer 2018 internships, we will run an Initiation Bootcamp on data science research skills. All DSI Scholars are encouraged to attend.

+ *Scholars in Data Science* weekly meetup series - Throughout the summer, this weekly series will provide *DSI Scholars* the opportunities to learn about data science research outside their own project. Each session will be led by a data scientist at Columbia and will consist of a 45-minute seminar talk and a 45-minute hands-on activity.

+ Fall 2018 *DSI Scholars Research Poster Social*: All DSI Scholars will be invited to present their summer research during a DSI poster social at the beginning of the Fall semester 2018-2019.

**The Data Science Institute encourages women and underrepresented minorities to apply to this program.**
