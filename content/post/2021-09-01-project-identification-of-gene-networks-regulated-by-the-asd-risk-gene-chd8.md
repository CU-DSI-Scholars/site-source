The focus of our research is on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the neural pathways, neurodevelopment, and genes implicated in ASD.  We will be focusing on the gene CHD8, which is a regulatory gene expressed in the early fetal brain. The aim of this research is to map CHD8 cell-type specific networks in the cortex.  We will be using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (bioChIP-seq) to identify the cell type and lineage specific regulatory networks controlled by CHD8 that are critical for neurodevelopment and ASD risk.  We will perform bioChIP-seq using an epitope-tagged Chd8-3XFLAG-Avi transgenic mouse by crossing the mouse with a conditionally activated biotin ligase called BirA to generate mouse line Chd8-3XFLAG-Avi; neo-BirA. This mouse can be crossed with Cre driver lines to activate biotinylation of tagged Chd8 in specific cell types. Following bioChIP-seq, we will use the program HOMER to determine statistically significant target sites found in CHD8-3XFLAG-Avi-Biotin complexes in comparison with bioChIP-seq performed using non-biotinylated tagged Chd8.  The identified peaks will then be matched to genes and this data will be used to generate a cell-type specific regulatory network of genes and enhancers bound by Chd8 that will be assessed for additional genetic risk factors.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Rebecca Muhle](https://childadolescentpsych.cumc.columbia.edu/faculty/rebecca-muhle-md)
+ Center/Lab: Muhle Lab
+ Location: Pardes Building (NYSPI) 4935
+ Rebecca Muhle, MD, PhD  (Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Columbia University) earned her medical and graduate degrees from the Medical Scientist Training Program at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and completed her adult psychiatry residency and child & adolescent fellowship training within the Solnit Integrated Adult and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale University Child Study Center. Dr. Muhleâ€™s scientific research aims to uncover molecular genetic pathways that increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, by utilizing high-throughput genomics methods in mouse and human model systems to examine the effects of disruptions of implicated risk genes.
