For 350 years the scientific literature has been designed such that scientific knowledge and discoveries can be shared and understood by human beings.  With the acceleration in the pace of research in the 21st century, and the rise of data science, there is now a need to develop a different model for the scientific literature such that the products of the research, currently articles, can be read directly by machines as well as humans.  This will accelerate scientific discovery because AI and Machine Learning methods can be applied more easily to the resulting research products.   This is a pilot project to demonstrate a proof of principle, highlighting the benefits and challenges of this vision for the scientific literature of the future.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Simon J. L. Billinge](thebillingegroup.com)
+ Center/Lab: Billinge Group
+ Location: 1105 Mudd
+ Our group focuses on developing methodologies for solving the ‘nanostructure problem‘: determining the structure of materials at the atomic scale to help understand structure-synthesis-property relationships in complex and functional materials . We develop and utilize experimental procedures at high flux x-ray and neutron producing facilities coupled with software and AI/ML solutions for high throughput data and structural analysis, solution, and prediction at the nanoscale. We apply these tools toward amorphous and nanostructured pharmaceuticals and molecular materials,  nanoscale fluctuations in exotic electronic materials, nanostructured materials for energy and environmental remediation, among many other topics.
