The REACH OUT study is a multi-institutional collaboration funded by the Health Effects Institute to determine if populations who have been chronically exposed to higher levels of air pollution are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. This is a paid position which will provide students with the opportunity to use analytic approaches on public health and environmental data. The selected student will work as part of a research team to analyze publicly available COVID-related and environmental data from the New York City Department of Health. They will also integrate findings with those from harmonized electronic health records and conduct simulations to assess the potential for selection bias in study populations. All analyses will be performed using R/R Studio. Students will be expected to create shareable and commented code as part of this work. Students will also create visualizations to communicate study results in publications and presentations.
