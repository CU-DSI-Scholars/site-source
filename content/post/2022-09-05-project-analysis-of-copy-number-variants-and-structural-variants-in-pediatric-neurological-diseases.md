Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) comprise of a group of disorders associated with abnormal brain development. Rare genetic variants have been shown to play a key role in their development, especially in those NDDs which are severe in nature. During the last decade, genetic testing has emerged as an important etiological diagnostic test for NDDs with a considerable impact on disease management and treatment. Yet, current genetic testing has a diagnostic rate of ~ 50%. Due to technical limitations in modern next-generation sequencing techniques, these techniques fail to asses a large part of the genome (2/3rd), missing critical regions which may have clinical significance. New methods now have emerged that can assess these regions better, can access repetitive regions and identify complex structural genomic events with more accuracy. This project will employ and integrate novel genomic technologies, including optical genome mapping and long read sequencing, to perform a comprehensive investigation of the human genome in parent-child trios which remained genetically unsolved after standard genomic approaches.
