I am conducting studies on meal timing and circadian rest-activity rhythms in relation to cardiometabolic outcomes. Sample sizes of my studies range from n=100 to n=16,000.

## Outcome

Analytic support: I need a statistician to help with analyses and happy to provide co-authorship as appropriate on resulting papers.

## Learning opportunity

Opportunity to conduct analyses on lifestyle in relation to cardiometabolic risk in population-based studies and possibly be a co-author on resulting publications.
