We are developing machine learning (ML) methods to understand how people influence each othersâ€™ behavior in social networks. For example, on Twitter, do users influence the content shared or posted by their followers? Methods that can identify such patterns of influence will play a role in studying, e.g., the spread of misinformation on social media sites.

The research intern will be mentored by and work closely with Dhanya Sridhar, a postdoc in the Blei lab. We are extending her initial work on estimating social influence with ML models of social networks. She developed a method that uses observed social network data and applies latent variable models to discover patterns of influence. 

There are several important problems that remain as future work, which we will address during this internship.
The goals of this internship are two-fold: 1) implement technical extensions that will improve the performance of the method and 2) collect a real-world network dataset to demonstrate applications of our proposed methods.
