eMERGE is a NIH-funded national network of 10 sites that enroll participants into genetic research. It has had 3 earlier cycles with tens of thousands of participants recruited in each; the current cycle (eMERGE IV) plans to enroll 25,000 individuals, with a particular focus on patients from underserved communities. The network has developed several participant surveys that allow the collection of data across the sites.  This study focuses on participants who self-identified as people with disabilities as well as those who have chronic conditions such as kidney disease or type 1 diabetes. Issues to be explored include diverse representation in cohort, recruitment and retention, identify stated needs for participation, health behaviors, and expectations surrounding genetic testing for common diseases. Tasks required to fulfill study aims are literature review, quantitative data analyses skills, familiarity with e-health records and ICD codes, and drafting of manuscript; the projected outcome is a manuscript in a peer-review journal.
