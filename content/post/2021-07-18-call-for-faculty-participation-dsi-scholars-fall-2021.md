### Call for Faculty Participation. Fall 2021.

The Data Science Institute is calling for faculty submissions of research projects for the pring and/or summer 2021 sessions of the Data Science Institute (DSI) Scholars Program. The goal of the DSI Scholars Program is to engage undergraduate and master students to work with Columbia faculty, through the creation of data science research internships. Last year, we worked with 38 projects and received more than 400 unique applications from Columbia Students. The program's unique enrichment activities foster a learning and collaborative community in data science at Columbia. Apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQNPZYgxVAcJyaoWUPmJA1WtMYrFEh8bBiG_LNeGSwWYHmhw/viewform).

+ **Funding support**: For selected projects, the DSI will provide matching funds of up to $2,500 per project for internship-supporting stipends. Approximately 10 such stipend funds will be awarded. This fund is expected to be a fraction of a full stipend that is appropriate for the time and effort required by the research project. The DSI Scholars program recommends that the PI/lab engage DSI scholars approximately 5-8 hours a week during the academic semester and consider a full-time or part-time research internship during summer. Allocation of funds will be made via a first-come-first-serve need-based process, with efforts to balance allocation across disciplines, to prioritize new PIs/labs/projects, and support novel interdisciplinary research.

+ **Administrative support**: The DSI will collect faculty-submitted internship positions and create an umbrella application page to solicit student applications. The collected applications for each position will be compiled and sent to the hosting faculty/center/lab for review. The faculty/center/lab will then review, identify and notify the Scholars for their own projects. Funded projects will receive additional support through the coordination of stipends with Student Financial services. 

+ **Intellectual support** via the DSI Scholars enrichment activities: The DSI education committee will organize the following enrichment activities for the DSI Scholars Program.

    + Bootcamps on Data Science Research Skills - During the first weeks of summer 2022, we will run bootcamps on data science research skills. All students who have been selected for a DSI Scholars project (receiving matching funds or not) are especially encouraged to attend, with additional seats available for other interested applicants.
    + Scholars in Data Science meetup series - Throughout this series, we will provide Scholars opportunities to learn about data science research outside their own project and a community of peer student researchers. Each session will be led by a data scientist at Columbia and will consist of a 45-minute seminar talk and a 45-minute hands-on activity.
    + Annual Research Poster Session: All DSI Scholars (receiving matching funds or not) will be invited to present their research during a DSI poster session at DSI Town Hall in the fall 2021 semester.

# NEW FOR FALL 2021

+ **Limited Submission Micro Grant for DSI Scholars Projects at the Intersection for Racial Equity & Inclusion**

The DSI Equity Advisory Council welcomes project proposals from faculty to find student scholars to work on a project at the intersection of data science, diversity, equity and inclusion. Projects selected for this funding opportunity to support students will not require matching funds from the faculty. The limited opportunity is proudly sponsored by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. 

Use the same link for the DSI Scholar Proposal Submission and specify in the "Special Requirements" response box if you wish to be considered for this program. Proposals selected may be eligible for up to $2,500 to support a student scholar.
