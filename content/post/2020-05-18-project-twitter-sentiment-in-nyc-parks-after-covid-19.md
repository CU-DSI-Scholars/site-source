During the period 2017-2019 the Earth Institute Urban Design Lab (UDL) in collaboration with  Data Science faculty and students was engaged in a studio of Twitter-based sentiment analysis that explored correlation of indicators of “well-being” within New York City parks in comparison with outside, published as ["Twitter sentiment in New York City parks as measure of well-being"](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204618305863>) in Landscape and Urban Planning Volume 189, September 2019, Pages 235-246.

The research relied on an 18-month database [now approaching 36 months of data collection]. The UDL proposes to continue this research in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This second phase will analyze changes in sentiment in parks during a pivotal moment, after the most intense period of the COVID-19 sequestration, when parks reopen and will have/have not a heightened role at a moment of behavioral recalibration. With this note we are expressing our interest to work with Data Science graduate students/post-docs on this topic. The selected candidate(s) will have statistical and social media expertise, and interest in the overall topic.

## Outcome

Data organization, sound criteria for cleaning, and interpretation of parameters. Documentation of every step. Superior communication skills.

## Learning opportunity

Mastering the skill of twitter analysis integrated with skill analysis for urban public spaces
