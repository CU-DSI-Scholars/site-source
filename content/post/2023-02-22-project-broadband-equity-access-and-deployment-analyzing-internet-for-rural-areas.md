I'm currently working, on loan, for NTIA (ntia.gov) on the BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment), a roughly $40 billion project to deploy high-speed internet to all or most locations that currently lack access. We have a public and semi-public data set that lists every home and business in the United States, as well as broadband deployments and government grants.The project will answer questions such as: What will it cost to deploy fiber? Where are community anchor institutions located? What locations are already being subsidized? Which locations without service are in high-poverty areas?
