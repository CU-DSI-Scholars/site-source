Project components: (i) Monitoring of traffic intersections, using birdâ€™s eye cameras, supported by ultra-low latency computational/communications hubs; (ii) Simultaneous video-based tracking of cars and pedestrians, and prediction of movement based on long-term observations of the intersection; (iii) Real-time computational processing, using deep learning, utilizing GPUs, in support of ii;  (iv) Sub-10ms latency communication between all vehicles and the computational/communication hub, to be used in support of autonomous vehicle navigation.

Students (DSI scholars) will pursue initial work in support of developing video data analysis applications to run on the testbed which will start being deployed by Columbia in a large area around Columbia and Harlem.
