Advances in genomic technologies have led to the identification of many novel disease-gene associations, allowing medical diagnoses to be more precise and tailored to an individual. However, the high number of variants present in each individual represents a significant challenge for the implementation of genomic medicine. The goal of this project is to enable the identification of novel genes associated with recessive disorders.

Researchers have already developed tools enabling the prioritization of genes potentially associated with dominant disorders. For example, constraint scores identify  highly conserved genes (few observed variants in the population). Variants in these genes are investigated as disease-causing assuming that two functional copies are essential to a specific biological process. 

The identification of novel genes associated with recessive disorders is more difficult.  Several research groups have developed bioinformatic approaches to quantify enrichment for bi-allelic variants (homozygote and compound heterozygote variants).  However, they are cohort dependent and do not easily apply to different populations.  

The students will be expected to process a large dataset of familial samples (2 or more first-degree relatives) using existing approaches to calculate the expected number of bi-allelic variants both genome-wide and at the gene-level.
