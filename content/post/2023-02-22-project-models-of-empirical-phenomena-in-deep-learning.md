The goal of this project is to develop and mathematically analyze simple models of empirical phenomena observed in deep learning.

<!--more-->


Over the past decade, deep learning has emerged as a dominant paradigm for machine learning, but many aspects of it remain poorly understood. An example of such a question is the following: How does the training process used for deep neural networks uncover features of data that are useful for prediction tasks? Such a question is difficult to answer in full generality, since the "feature learning" phenomenon varies greatly from one application to another. But by restricting to a narrow-enough regime, one may hope to develop a useful theory for understanding the phenomenon.

This project will begin with a literature review to identify robust empirical phenomena of interest, followed by iterative development of probabilistic/mechanistic models that are amenable to theoretical analysis.
