Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing the acquisition of HIV.  However, achieving the population-level impact of this intervention is contingent on the identification and linkage of appropriate candidates and ongoing engagement in care throughout periods of high and low risk.  Pre-COVID we had a suite of active studies looking at engagement in PrEP care.  These included  our PrEP database, Get2PrEP (studying individuals with positive STI tests but no PrEP engagement), Back2PrEP (evaluating patients who dropped out of care and re-engaged), Lost2PrEP (survey of individuals who have been out of care for 6 months or more), and our major study Stick2PrEP2.0 a randomized-control trial of text message based feedback to individuals receiving PrEP care and evaluating engagement.  At the time of the COVID pandemic we had just started to perform interim analysis on Stick2PrEP2.0.

Stick2PrEP2.0 includes a detailed enrollment survey, a brief weekly survey, a slightly longer Q6 week survey, data from our PrEP database, and labs/medication/visit data from the EMR.

While Stick2PrEP2.0 is slightly on hold due to COVID we are planning to launch Stick2PrEP3.0 in the next few weeks.

## Outcome

We are currently interested in assistance with analyzing engagement in care (as demonstrated by testing and visits) and STI positivity over time. We are looking for predictors of disengagement at 3 points; enrollment (detailed enrollment survey), at individuals visits, and in the longitudinally home collected data.   

As an additional analysis we are strongly interested in longitudinal analysis of sexually transmitted infection data, predictors for infection/positivity to determine the optima screening interval.

## Learning opportunity

I believe that there are numerous opportunities for education in this project from; summarization of data, basic univariate and multivariate analysis, data visualizations, and analysis of longitudinally collected self-collected data (with all the pitfalls and missing data that are included)

The Data For Good program is designed primarily for volunteers, however one candidate will be selected as a project coordinator and will receive a stipend via the Data For Good Scholars program. In addition to the responsibilities of a team member, the selected candidate will be responsible for keeping up-to-date notes on the project's status, writing an end-of-period report, and attending bi-weekly meetings with a DFG program director. The project coordinator should strive to keep the group of volunteers in sync with the needs of the project owner.

+ Department/School: CUIMC- Department of Medicnie, Division of Infectious Diseases
+ Location: CUMC

## Project Timeline
+ Anticipated workload: Flexible and unclear
+ Duration: This work was put on hold by the COVID pandemic and I would love to try and get it back on track with some assistance from the data science institute.  While we do not have any strict timelines we are currently planning for a Stick2PrEP2.0 abstract submission to HIVR4P in July, a publication targeted at the STD journal in the next 8 weeks, a presentation at IAPAC Adherence in November (recently rescheduled from June) and an NIH R21 submission in September.

## Candidate requirements
+ Skills required: Not a dealbreaker but have a preference for R over python simply because it's what I use and can review the code.
+ Additional domain knowledge: No knowledge is required, I'm happy to teach.
+ Student eligibility: ~~freshman~~, ~~sophomore~~, junior, senior, master's
+ Additional comments: This data does involves sexually transmitted infection prevention, HIV/HIV prevention, and the LGBTQ population, comfort with that subject matter is appreciated.
