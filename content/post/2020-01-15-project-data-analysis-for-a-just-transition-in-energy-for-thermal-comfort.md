42% of New York City greenhouse gas emissions result from on-site fossil fuel combustion in residential and commercial buildings; space heating is, by far, the majority contributor. Both New York State and NYC have policies to dramatically reduce emissions that will require a transformation in the way buildings are heated, including major efforts in existing buildings. This transition is inextricably linked to existing energy equity issues that we believe significantly overlap across NYC (and elsewhere). These include unreliable heating in the winter, susceptibility to extreme heat (an increasing occurrence with climate change) and struggles to afford energy needs. Various known data sources for NYC are available, though they are disparate and have not been analyzed holistically. Further, we believe there are potential engineering and policy solutions to these challenges. In this project, the DSI scholar will access (and search for where not yet known to qSEL researchers) relevant data sets, analyze those data sets to identify communities exposed to all or a subset of these issues, and assist qSEL researchers in developing models to evaluate possible solutions. The project has the possibility of extending through Summer 2020, subject to fundraising efforts and the success of the Spring 2020 project.

The supporting program for this project has not yet been resolved and it may be an unpaid, DSI Scholars activity, a Data For Good venture, or not active this term. If you are interested in applying, please wait until January 22, 2020 before submitting and we should have a determination at that time.
<!-- The Data For Good program is designed primarily for volunteers, however one candidate will be selected as a project coordinator and will receive a stipend via the Data For Good Scholars program. In addition to the responsibilities of a team member, the selected candidate will be responsible for keeping up-to-date notes on the project's status, writing an end-of-period report, and attending bi-weekly meetings with a DFG program director. The project coordinator should strive to keep the group of volunteers in sync with the needs of the project owner. -->
