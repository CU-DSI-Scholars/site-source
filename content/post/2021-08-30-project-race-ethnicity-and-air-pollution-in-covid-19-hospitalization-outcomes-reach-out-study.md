The REACH OUT study is a multi-institutional collaboration funded by the Health Effects Institute to determine if populations who have been chronically exposed to higher levels of air pollution are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The project will involve working with a harmonized repository of electronic health record data from multiple healthcare institutions in NYC that will be linked at the zip code level to city-wide air pollution data and neighborhood-level census variables. The project aims are:

<!--more-->


Aim 1: Estimate the combined effect of chronic air pollution and neighborhood-level vulnerability on an individual’s risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and determine if these exposures explain observed racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.

Aim 2: Calculate excess risk of death due to COVID-19 using all-cause mortality data from the previous 5 years versus the current year and compare differences across neighborhoods with varying levels of chronic air pollution exposure.

This is a paid position which will provide students with the opportunity to use advanced analytic approaches to model high-dimensional data. End-products can include abstracts for conference presentation and journal publications. Students will join the team’s regular research meetings (via Zoom) where they can obtain feedback on works-in-progress.
