DSI Scholars is different from conventional *researh experience for students* programs by providing enrichment activities that build a community of data science learning and research.

In Summer 2018, we kicked off a summer of data science research with a [five-day bootcamp](https://datascience.columbia.edu/scholars/bootcamp). Every week during summer 2018, the scholars learned about one area of data science research from a Columbia researcher. Below are the presenters of our meetup series during summer 2018.
