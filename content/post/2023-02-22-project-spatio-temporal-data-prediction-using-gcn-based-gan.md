In this project, we aim to develop GCN-based GAN models to predict spatio-temporal evolution using open human mobility datasets â€“ SafeGraph (https://www.safegraph.com/).

<!--more-->


M.S. are welcome to register my research credits during the semesters and summer. The student involved in this project will develop GAN based models that can predict. spatio-temporal evolution of human mobility. Students with coding skills and past experience in analyzing spatio-temporal data and training GAN and GCN/GNN models are preferred. Skill requirements are:
1.	Familiar with Python. Generating figures, graphs, tables, or statistical models to present results with python. 
2.	Familiar with GAN and its variant models.
3.	Familiar with GCN/GNN.
4.	Having past experience in doing research and demonstrating independent research capabilities.
