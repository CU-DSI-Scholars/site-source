The wireless revolution is fueling the demand for access to the radio frequency spectrum. Smartphones, wearables, modern cars, and smart homes are all competing for spectrum resources. Managing this increasing demand is an important and timely research challenge. Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (DSA) methods allow multiple wireless networks to collaboratively adapt in real-time to dynamic RF frequency environments. In this project, we consider intelligent wireless networks that exchange Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs) in order to dynamically coordinate the spectrum usage aiming to avoid harmful interference. Students working on this project will construct SCMs based on real measurements of wireless signals, develop novel frequency coordination protocols based on SCMs, and implement the protocols in a custom-built python simulator and/or in a Software-Defined Radio testbed.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Gil Zussman](https://wimnet.ee.columbia.edu)
+ Center/Lab: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
+ Location: CEPSR 8th floor
+ The Wireless and Mobile Networking lab focuses on next generation (beyond-5G) wireless networks and cover the entire spectrum between the physical layer and the application layer. Specifically, projects focus on applying learning tools to networks and on using networks to support learning and inference (for example, in smart city environments).
