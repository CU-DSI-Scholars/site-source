We will leverage and extend large language models and ChatGPT or GPT-3 technologies to retrieve, appraise and synthesize clinical evidence for patients and clinicians.  Students with strong background in large language models and natural language processing will be preferred. We will be working closely with clinicians to fine tune the methods.
