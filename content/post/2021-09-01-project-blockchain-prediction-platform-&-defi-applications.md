Develop a new  decentralized prediction market that can be used to elicit opinions of university researchers on socially important issues It uses smart contracts and web3.js (or web3.py) for the frontend and backend. It will be initially deployed to predict sports events by students in a number of programs. DSI scholars will assist in creation of the platform and analyzing data. 
2. Prediction of credit-worthiness on DeFi platforms. A new project under consideration. It  will look at the transactions of various DeFi platforms including Compound and and create metrics for credit reputation of accounts from publicly available data on Ethereum and other DeFi platforms.
