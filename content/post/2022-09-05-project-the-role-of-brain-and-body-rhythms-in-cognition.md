We are constantly exposed to input from the outside world, but we do not perceive nor remember everything we encounter. The state of our brains right before we receive such sensory inputs influences whether or not we process them. Brain oscillations are proposed to play a key role in setting these brain states; however, how exactly these brain rhythms influence perception and other cognitive processes remains a topic of active research. The Brain Rhythms Lab investigates how brain rhythms gate information through the brain, how they facilitate interactions with the rest of the body, and how these rhythms influence cognitive functions.

In this project, we will investigate the functional role of brain rhythms in cognitive processes such as attention, perception, and memory, in healthy human participants. We will address how these brain rhythms interact with the cardiac and respiratory systems, and study their combined influence on cognitive performance. For this purpose, we will record electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and respiratory activity while participants perform different cognitive tasks. For instance, participants will be asked to remember a series of images (animals, objects, or places) shown on a computer screen for a few seconds, after which they have to report which images they previously saw. 

You will be able to participate in different stages of the research process, including participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and reporting of results. Data analysis involves EEG/ECG signal processing (artifact detection, time-frequency transformations, data visualization) and statistical testing. Together, this project provides a great opportunity to develop the necessary skills to do research in the field of cognitive neuroscience.

## Faculty Advisor
+ Professor: [Saskia Haegens](https://www.haegenslab.com)
+ Center/Lab: Division of Systems Neuroscience
+ Location: Brain Rhythms Lab
+ The Brain Rhythms lab is interested in the functional role of neuronal oscillations in controlling the flow of information through the brain. We use EEG and MEG in healthy human participants, as well as electrophysiology in patients and animal models, to study brain dynamics in the context of perception & cognition.
