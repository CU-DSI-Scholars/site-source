NYC DDC has initiated a machine learning project to develop predictive model for estimating cost of project and work items. Using the latest technique in Machine Learning and Advanced Statistics, NYC DDC to develop a model that predicts the cost of future and active projects and construction work items in different phases of the lifecycle of the project based on historical data. DDC has partnered with Microsoft who is providing the proof of concept guidance and making tools available for the proof of concept development. DDC is seeking assistance of a data scientist from the Town and Gown program to develop the model.

Tasks expected from the data scientist candidate:
+ Explore and understand the data provided by DDC
+ Communicate iteratively with DDC Data Analytics team and Microsoft AI team to discuss meaningful insights 
+ Interpret the data and draw meaningful inferences especially dealing with small datasets
+ Test and select a most optimum algorithm to build a model
