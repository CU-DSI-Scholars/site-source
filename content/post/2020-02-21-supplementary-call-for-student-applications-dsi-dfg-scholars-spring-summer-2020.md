We have two additional projects ([1](https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2020/02/project-cryptocurrency-analytics-identifying-bad-actors/),[2](https://cu-dsi-scholars.github.io/DSI-scholars/2020/02/project-understanding-orientation/)) and are thus opening another round of applications. You can apply for these projects [here](https://forms.gle/xA5ZCXuUr6Jgh2Zk9). The deadline for this application is **Friday, February 28th at 11:59pm**.

If you applied previously, the original application [form](https://forms.gle/FirneensvXgZGE6HA) has been unlocked so that you can access your application materials. Do not use this form to resubmit - it will be ignored.
