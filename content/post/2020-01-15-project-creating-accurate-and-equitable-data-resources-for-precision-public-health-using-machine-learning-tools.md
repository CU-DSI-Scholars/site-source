The objective of this project is to construct linkages across disparate public health data systems using machine learning tools and assess them for bias and equitable representation of subpopulations defined by demographic and socioeconomic factors.

<!--more-->

There is a growing emphasis on the potential for data science initiatives to revolutionize medicine and healthcare. There has been less focus on the need to apply data science techniques to the already extensive data collected and maintained by public health agencies in order to transform our ability to monitor, evaluate and improve population health. Our approaches to data linkage must be both accurate and equitable, to ensure that the advances in public health they stimulate benefit all communities. Through this project, we aim to identify how matching algorithms may be optimized to improve performance across diverse populations and ultimately validate the use of these data linkages for epidemiologic research. 

The selected student will work onsite at the Department of Health in Queens, NY and be co-mentored by Columbia faculty and scientists at the NYC Department of Health. Tasks may include writing, reviewing and testing scripts within the AI-based matching software, identifying key predictive features to optimize the matching algorithm, summarizing key results and improving system documentation.
