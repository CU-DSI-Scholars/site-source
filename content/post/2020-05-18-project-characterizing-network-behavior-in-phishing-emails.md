Targeted phishing is one of the most common and damaging cybersecurity attacks, incurring tens of billions of dollars in losses a year. In order to increase the success of the phishing emails, attackers often craft emails that impersonate real people or legitimate online services, and send them from networks and hosting sites that have a high reputation. This leads major email security services, including Outlook and Gmail, to often misclassify these emails as legitimate.

In this summer research project, we will characterize the network signals in phishing emails on a proprietary email dataset in collaboration with Barracuda Networks. We plan to get a better understanding of where attackers send phishing emails, whether they relay these emails across multiple servers, and whether there are signals in the envelope of the email, all of which could lead to better detection of these attacks. Most of the prior characterizing network data for email is outdated, and primarily focuses on spam and not on targeted attacks. So we believe there is a significant potential for this project to be impactful.
 
Interested students should email a brief description of why they are interested in the project and what they hope to get from it (including rough time period and rough hours per week they hope to work), a CV/resume, an (unofficial) transcript, and (if available) links to Github repositories of related previous work or sample code.
