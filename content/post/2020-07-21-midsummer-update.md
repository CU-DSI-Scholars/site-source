Interested in a late-summer research project, or want to get a jump on the fall semester? We are restructing the application process for the Data Science Institute and Data for Good Scholars programs, but until that system is in place any projects we receive will be sent to [this](https://lists.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/dsi-2020summerresearch) interim mailing list. Subscribe for notifications.

Please note that in the fall an entirely new system will be used. We hope to be able to accept applications for both programs in **early September**.

Please email questions to <dsi-scholars@columbia.edu>.
