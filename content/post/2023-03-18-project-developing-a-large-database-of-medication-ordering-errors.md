Over 400,000 deaths per year are the result of preventable harm,1 with medication errors contributing to a large proportion of these errors.2  Specifically, errors at the ordering are particularly at risk for causing serious patient harm.3-5

A novel automated measure of wrong patient ordering errors, using the Retract-and-Reorder (RAR) methodology, has been used to evaluate multiple interventions to prevent wrong patient errors, with the results published in multiple large impact journals (e.g. JAMA).7-9  Further studies, currently in the manuscript stage, have validated new automated measures of ordering errors. 
Our research team is now developing a database with over 100 million orders and approximately 250,000 RAR events. The database will contain detailed records of clinical encounters, including details around each order placed, as well as patient, clinical, and unit characteristics.  Once complete, the database will allow clinical scientists to ask a myriad of questions regarding the association of provider and patient demographics with electronic ordering errors. In addition, the database will allow for the development of machine learning models that aim to predict, and ultimately help prevent, these errors.
We aim to recruit data scientists to help to continue to develop this database, which will be the largest known database of electronic ordering errors. The student will also help with the creation of a Python program which will ensure the previously developed measures are easily extrapolated to institutions throughout the United States. Those with specific machine learning skills can also work to  identify machine learning algorithms to predict these errors.  The data scientist will work with the Dr. Adelman, Chief Patient Safety Officer at CUIMC, and a team of physicians and informaticians. Output of this project will inform clinicians in developing conducting research as it relates to patient safety interventions with the ultimate goal of improving patient care.
