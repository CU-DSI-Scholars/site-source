This study aims to determine the effect of structural racism on cognitive aging. We are looking at many different aspects of structural racism (civics, education, employment, environment, healthcare, income/credit/wealth, media/marketing, neighborhood factors, and policing), and several variables to measure each aspect. We will be acquiring several large data sets that have data from multiple years. We will be linking all these datasets to determine exposure to structural racism based on geographic location in the United States over the years. We will then link this to a longitudinal dataset with participantsâ€™ residences over their lifetime as well as measures of cognitive aging.  Our analysis will primarily employ Structural Equation Modeling, but we will also conduct factor analyses and psychometric analyses. We will be analyzing each aspect individually, and as part of a larger model.
