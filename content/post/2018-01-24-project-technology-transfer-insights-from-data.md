CTVâ€™s core mission is to facilitate the transfer of inventions from academic labs to the market for the benefit of society. In a typical year, CTV receives ~400 inventions, completes ~100 licenses and options, and helps form ~20 startups. A good video summary of CTV is here: <https://vimeo.com/110193999>.

Success in technology transfer can involve a confluence of research funding, invention, intellectual property management, development, licenses and/or start-ups, and tech transfer offices like ours. Data on these factors exist, but are disparate. We are looking for a data science intern to

	  + wrangle and standardize data from these sources
	  + document and create a few demonstration analyses to allow third party use of these sources

The goal is to host a multi-institution hackathon in the late fall to produce insights that could improve university technology transfer.
