Despite identification of modifiable behavioral targets for childhood obesity prevention, prevalence of obesity remains historically high in the United States and the most severe forms are increasing among young children. Disparities in obesity have been exacerbated in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this project is to examine the effects of social needs (eg food insecurity, housing needs), neighborhood factors, and use of social service referrals on childhood obesity before and after COVID-19. The data scholar will gain hands-on experience with data cleaning, merging, and visualizations. If appropriate to skill level, checking code and conducting analytic tests may be part of the learning experience. Opportunities for abstract and manuscript co-authorship may be possible for exceptional Scholars.
