Recently Columbia University, Cornell, and NewYork-Presbyterian have agreed to integrate their clinical (healthcare) and business IT systems onto one shared platform called Epic. The motivating factors to move to Epic are to enhance the patient experience, improve and integrate care, and give our physicians an integrated technology platform that supports the mission of an academic medical center. The intern will assist with developing the “operational” analytics capabilities of Columbia University Medical Center including financial, healthcare operations and healthcare quality analytics.

Financial analytics will include billing, charges, claims, and payments associated with clinical activities. Clinical operations analytics include analysis of waiting times, physician throughput, geographically mapping of patients to determine catchment areas. Clinical quality analytics include reportable data to public payers, private payers and governmental agencies. Additionally, the intern will assist with developing the research infrastructure analytics to help address the varying degrees of needs of each individual school (public health, nursing, dental and medical), departments, divisions and their researchers. We expect that the intern will have a working knowledge of SQL programming and one of python or R programming languages. Healthcare terminology is preferable but not needed as we expect the intern to gain that domain knowledge over the internship.
