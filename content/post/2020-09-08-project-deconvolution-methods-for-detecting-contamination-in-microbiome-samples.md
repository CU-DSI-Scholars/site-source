Complex microbial communities play an important role in numerous fields, from human health to bioremediation. One critical challenge in their data analysis is to separate true biological data from contamination of various sources. While contemporary experimental procedures include various negative controls, a comprehensive statistical approach for their analysis has not been developed. Such a framework would have a far-reaching impact on the field.

We have recently developed a scalable deconvolution algorithm ([FEAST](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0431-x)) that unveils the latent structure of a given microbial community by modeling it as a convex combination of potential observed and unobserved source ecosystems. While FEAST estimates the contribution of various contamination sources to each biological sample, it does not utilize the fact that different biological samples share the same contamination sources.

In this project, we will extend FEAST to utilize additional information gained in common experimental setups, effectively sharing contamination sources between samples. Specifically, we will develop a sequential inference algorithm that will take as input multiple samples from the same microbial environment, as well as potential sources of contaminations, and output the inferred “true” biological contribution of each sample. We will validate the resulting method on simulated and biological data.
