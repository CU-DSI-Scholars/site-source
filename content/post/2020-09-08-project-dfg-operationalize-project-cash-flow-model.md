In collaboration with DDC, Microsoft AI team has developed a predictive machine learning model that forecasts monthly distribution of cash flow for DDCâ€™s active projects. DDC intends to operationalize this model and possibly integrate into our dashboards.  Assistance is needed of a data scientist to collaborate with DDC in operationalizing the model whereby DDC can prepare the visuals and data scientist can assist with operationalizing the machine learning components.
