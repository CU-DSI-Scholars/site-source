+ **Question:** With only one application form, how do I express interest in more than one project?

If you feel the need, you can address a portion of your personal statement to the PIs of each program to which you are applying.

    *Answer*: All projects are open to qualified students. There is no restriction to specific academic programs.

+ **Question:** Is it possible to receive academic credit for participating in this program?

    *Answer*: Yes, however that determination is ultimately up to your department and the project's principal investigator. The option for academic credit is listed on each project's page. To see if you are eligible and to learn about the process for getting approved, contact a program officer or director of study in your department.
