In addition, the DSI can connect you to the to the [Statistics Consulting](http://stat.columbia.edu/consulting-information/) group. Statistics Consulting is a service offered year round to the Columbia community, connecting you with a highly trained student supervised by department faculty. They offer advice in statistical areas such as: study design, development of analysis strategy, data analysis, and reporting/interpretation of results. In addition to providing direct guidance on your project, statistics consulting can be used in conjunction with students recruited through the above programs if you would like to secure additional expertise.
