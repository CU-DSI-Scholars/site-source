+ **Question:** I am living remotely and have restricted availability during the workday in the U.S. Eastern time zone. Can I still apply?

    *Answer*: Most faculty are understanding of the difficulties of relocation and quarantine endured during COVID-19. The ability to participate on individual projects will vary by faculty with respect to the nature of the project and whether or not there are limitations with accessing research data. Our suggestion would be to indicate your location and availability for online communication.

+ **Question:** With only one application form, how do I express interest in more than one project?

    *Answer*: It is recommended that you prioritize based on your interest and skills. To a large extent, the methods of data science can be translated from one domain to another so demonstrating core competency is paramount. If you feel the need, you can address a portion of your personal statement to the PIs of each program to which you are applying.

+ **Question:** I recently graduated in May, 2020. Am I still eligible for the program?

    *Answer*: Unfortunately, this program is oriented towards current students.

+ **Question:** How long will the internship last?

    *Answer*: The duration of each project is listed on the project's page. Some projects may be looking for a long-term commitment. If you are selected to be interviewed by a faculty sponsor, you are encouraged to discuss the particulars of the scope of work and anticipated timeline involved.

+ **Question:** Do projects come with a stipend, and if not are they available for credit?

    *Answer*: The funding status of each project is listed on the project's page. If you are selected to be interviewed by a faculty sponsor, you are encouraged to discuss the particulars of funding at that time. Course credit is a possibility, but depends on your academic program and department. Contact your department's academic affairs administrator to see if a project is eligible.

+ **Question:** Is there still space to host interns for this program?  I have a student researcher in my lab who was interested in participating.

    *Answer*: The distribution of matching funds has ended. However, we will be happy to host your student researcher in our learning activities as a DSI Scholar for the Summer.

+ **Question:** I am a student in program A and am interested in Project B. Am I eligible to apply?

    *Answer*: All projects are open to qualified students. There is no restriction to specific academic programs.

+ **Question:** I will be working as a student researcher in lab XX under the supervision of Professor YY this semester. I am interested in participating in the DSI scholars program's activities (e.g., boot camp, weekly meet-ups, etc). Can I apply?

    *Answer*: Yes, with your faculty advisor's permission, you are welcome to participate when space permits. The matching fund for stipend has all been given out but we welcome all undergraduate researchers to participate in the DSI scholars activities such as the boot camp, the weekly series and the fall poster social. Please write to <dsi-scholars@columbia.edu>.

## DSI Students

+ **Question:** A project is listed here and sent over Campus Connections. Through which one should I apply?

    *Answer*: Some projects might overlap with the projects that we shared with you through Campus Connections in the past two weeks. If you ahave contacted faculty directly and received a reply, you do not need to apply through both programs. However, if you are still interested in applying and have not yet submitted or not received a reply, please use this portal as well.

+ **Question:** Is it possible to receive a research elective credit for a DSI Scholars project?

    *Answer*: Once you are selected for a project and if you are interested in requesting the project to be reviewed for DSI approved elective research credits, please email [Violet](mailto:zy2286@columbia.edu) to follow up.
