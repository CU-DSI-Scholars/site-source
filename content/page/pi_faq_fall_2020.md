+ **Question:** How does the DSI Scholars stipend/matching fund process work?

    *Answer*: Stipends are issued directly by Student Financial Services in coordination with the Data Science Institute. PIs for selected projects will be asked to make a commitment as to the level of their support, after which the DSI will arrange for the stipend to be issued. Simultaneously, the DSI staff will work with the PI's department administrators to transfer the base amount to the DSI. _Please note_: stipends are only issued once per term (fall, spring, summer), so if a deadline is missed there may be some delay in arranging a payment to your student.

+ **Question:** Why is the stipend mechanism used? Can I hire a student directly and still receive the matching fund?

    *Answer*: The stipend mechanism is preferred as it allows us to provide (potentially, if used against tuition) tax-free support, avoid the complications of hiring, and do so with no overhead. It should be considered a cost-of-living adjustment for summer research internships. If you've already hired a student or wish to bring one on as a casual hire, we will work with your department administrators to arrange a payment. _Please note:_ the DSI can only help with formal stipends, not with hiring.

+ **Question:** Is it required to use the stipend during the summer?

    *Answer*: No. It is up to the PI to decide how to use the fund. However, we suggest that, as an internship, time spent during the academic year is not compensated. The primary benefit to the student is the experience provided.

+ **Question:** My project wasn't selected for a matching fund. Can the DSI still help me find a student?

    *Answer*: Yes. We are happy to provide match-making services to as many projects as possible. Selected students will still be eligible for educational support activities.

+ **Question:** I'm not sure that my project is a good fit for the program. Are there any other options?

    *Answer*: Yes. The DSI maintains a number of programs that can connect you with student or faculty resources. Please submit your project through [Campus Connections](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/connections), or contact us at dsi-scholars@columbia.edu.

+ **Question:** I missed the deadline to apply, can I still participate?

    *Answer*: Yes. If there is still is time, we will add your project to our umbrella application process. If there is not time, the DSI maintains a number of ways to help you recruit students and we would be happy to help. In either case, please submit your project through [Campus Connections](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/connections).

+ **Question:** Will there be another call in the Spring?

    *Answer*: Yes, we will repeat this process in December and January.

+ **Question:** My project was selected for a matching fund, but I missed the deadline to submit a student. Is my project still eligible for support?

    *Answer*: Yes. However, as we issue stipends only once per term, there may be some delay in arranging a payment to your student.
