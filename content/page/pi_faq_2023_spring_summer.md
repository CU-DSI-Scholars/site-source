+ **Question:** How does the DSI Scholars stipend/matching fund process work?

    *Answer*: This applies to the projects that have been selected for matching funds. Stipends are issued by Student Financial Services in coordination with the Data Science Institute using chart strings. PIs for selected projects will be asked to make a commitment as to the level of their support, after which the DSI will arrange for the stipend to be issued. For example, if you are contributing $2,000, DSI will match that for a total stipend of $4,000 per PI. Simultaneously, the DSI staff will work with the PI's department administrators to transfer the base amount to the DSI. The funds are disbursed to the student's Columbia student account at the end of the semester for which they worked on the project. Please note, DSI is unable to handle the payment of student stipends for projects that are funded solely by the PI because of the administrative overhead involved. For those, faculty are advised to work with their departmental administrators to process the stipend.
    
+ **Question:** What happens once my project gets selected for the Program? How do I choose student scholars?

    *Answer*: We will create a student call for applications to all the selected projects under one umbrella application form. We will collect student applications until early March, and then share with you a folder of applicants to your project by March 12th. You will have ~2 weeks to review all the applicants and select students for your project. We ask that you please let us know by April 15th of your selection, or provide an update if you weren't able to identify a student match for your project. This deadline allows necessary time to process and disburse the funds to the student's account before the semester ends. Therefore, it is especially important to keep in mind if your Scholar is graduating this semester since they won't be able to get paid via this method once their Columbia is de-activated.

+ **Question:** My project was just selected to the Program. I already have students inquiring about my project but it is not March 12th yet. What do I do?

    *Answer*: Though infrequent, unfortunately students sometimes try to by-pass the common application process by contacting the PIs directly to "apply"" via email. As you can imagine, this creates an unfair scenario for the students who are following the guidelines and the timeline DSI set forth to make this research opportunity available to a wide range of students around campus. So if this happens to you, we ask that you refer the student to the student call for applications and submit an application specifying your project as one of their preferred projects. Please note that this is different than a student who might email to ask questions about your project for clarification, which of course is acceptable.

+ **Question:** Why do I have to inform DSI of my selected Scholar? What is the purpose of the deadlines in the Program timeline?

    *Answer*: We need student information so that we can process the stipends and invite the selected students to the Scholars enrichment programs in the summer. Stipends cannot be issued retroactively, so it is crucial that you let us know as soon as you have selected a student so that we can start processing the stipends. Please note that graduating students are only eligible for stipends so long as they are currently enrolled at the time the stipend request is made with the Student Financial Services office. This is because DSI uses chart strings to process the payments internally, in coordination with your departmental administrator. Stipends are only issued once per term (fall, spring, summer), so if a deadline is missed there may be some delay in arranging a payment to your student. If you are unable to select a student from the applicant pool during the applicant review period, please let us know so that we can help you with the recruitment process.

+ **Question:** Why is the stipend mechanism used? Can I hire a student directly and still receive the matching fund?

    *Answer*: The DSI scholars program is a research experience program that provides a stipend to defray incidentials incurred during a research internship, and to foster new PI-student collaborations. As such, this is different than hourly casual hiring. To hire a research assistant directly, faculty can submit their project to [Campus Connections](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/connections) and indicate their preference.

+ **Question:** Is it required to use the stipend during a specific term?

    *Answer*: No, it is up to the PI to decide how to use the fund. However, we strongly recommend that time spent during the academic year is compensated with academic credit and that the stipend be used during the summer to support an internship. The primary benefit to students in the program is the experience provided.

+ **Question:** My project wasn't selected for a matching fund. Can the DSI still help me find a student?

    *Answer*: Yes. We are happy to provide match-making services to as many projects as possible. Selected students will still be eligible for educational support activities. If the nature of your project fits the Program goals (e.g., mentoring and learning opportunities for the student, a clear data science component in the project in which the student will engage), we can advertise your project as an unpaid project/internship opportunity. See below for more details on this route. 

+ **Question:** I don't have any funds of my own. Can I still participate?

    *Answer*: You can still recruit students through the program, but your project will not be eligible for matching funds. It is possible to structure your project as an unpaid internship, however it is important to abide by federal and state regulations. The ISSO maintains a valuable [overview](https://isso.columbia.edu/content/unpaid-internships-and-volunteering) of these regulations as they apply to all students. Projects focused on the social good may also seek volunteers through our Data For Good program. Please contact us at [dsi-scholars@columbia.edu](mailto:dsi-scholars@columbia.edu) for further information.

+ **Question:** I'm not sure that my project is a good fit for the program. Are there any other options?

    *Answer*: Yes. The DSI maintains a number of programs that can connect you with student or faculty resources. Please submit your project through [Campus Connections](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/connections), or contact us at [dsi-scholars@columbia.edu](mailto:dsi-scholars@columbia.edu). Please see [here](/page/dsi_programs) for high-level overview of DSI programs.

+ **Question:** Can I select more than one student?

    *Answer*: Yes. It is up to PIs to determine the best way for their projects to proceed. For projects selected for matching funds, if you recruit more than 1 student (which is common), then the total amount gets split amongst the selected Scholars (in however allocation the PI sees fit based on student effort level). 


+ **Question:** I missed the deadline to apply, can I still participate?

    *Answer*: Yes. If there is still is time, we will add your project to the umbrella application. If there is not time, the DSI maintains a number of ways to help you recruit students. In either case, please submit your project through [Campus Connections](https://datascience.columbia.edu/outreach/campus-connections/).

    
+ **Question:** Will there be another call in the Fall?

    *Answer*: Yes, we will repeat this process in August for the Fall 2023 semester.
